# odin-recipes
My First Project on The Odin Project (HMTL)

This first project deals with creating a simple webpage for cooking recipes and it is for me to showcase what i've learned so far. This includes Git and GitHub commands to add items to the repository, commiting and pushing it onto the server.

The project itself has me add HTML elements such as making the boilerplate, titles, headers, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, italicized and bold text as well as inserting images, relative links and absolute links into my website.
