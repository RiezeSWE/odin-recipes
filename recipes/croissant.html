            <h2>The recipe:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Dissolve the honey in the milk in a mixing bowl, and then whisk in the yeast. Set aside for the yeast to activate for about 10 - 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the rest of the ingredients into the bowl in the order listed in the ingredients list. Stir with a spatula or spoon to mix it into a scraggly dough.</li>
                <li>Using your hand, knead the dough for about 1 - 2 minutes until a scraggly dough is formed.</li>
                <li>Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it on a work surface until smooth - <strong>about 4 minutes.</strong> You shouldn’t have to put too much effort into kneading here because it isn’t a very stiff dough. Place the dough back in the mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap.</li>
                <li>Keep the bowl in a warm place, and proof until at least doubled in size (this can take about 1 hour).</li>
                <li>After the first proof, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and flatten it to knock out the air. Transfer the dough onto the second parchment paper and shape it into a rectangle. Fold the other half of the parchment paper over the dough, forming a 7 x 10 inch case. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to fit the 7 x 10 inch square. (It doesn’t have to fill the 7 x 10 inch square perfectly, just as closely as possible).</li>
                <li>A croissant magically spawns from the bowl, winning a nobel prize for advancements in the baking field (the croissant wins the award).</li>
